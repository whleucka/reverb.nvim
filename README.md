  event = "BufReadPre",
  opts = {
    player = "paplay", -- options: paplay (default), pw-play, mpv
    max_sounds = 20, -- Limit the amount of sounds that can play at the same time
    sounds = {
      -- Add custom sound paths or lists of sounds for other events here
      -- For example, BufRead can play a random sound from a list
      BufRead = { path = { sound_dir .. "start1.ogg", sound_dir .. "start2.ogg" }, volume = 0-100 },
      CursorMovedI = { path = sound_dir .. "click.ogg", volume = 0-100 },
      InsertLeave = { path = sound_dir .. "toggle.ogg", volume = 0-100 },
      ExitPre = { path = sound_dir .. "exit.ogg", volume = 0-100 },
